## Program Name

YNAB Budget Alerts

## Program Description

YNAB Budget Alerts is a private, household SMS/MMS notification service that automatically categorizes bank transactions and sends budget alerts to participating household members. When a transaction is detected on a linked bank account, the system sends a message with the merchant name, amount, and suggested budget category. Household members can reply to confirm, change, or manage the categorization.

This is a personal service operated for household budget management only. It is not a commercial product or marketing service.

## Message Frequency

Message frequency varies based on transaction activity. Participants can expect to receive approximately 1–5 messages per day, depending on spending patterns. Additional messages may be sent in response to participant replies (e.g., confirming a category, requesting more options).

## Message and Data Rates

Standard message and data rates may apply depending on your mobile carrier and plan. YNAB Budget Alerts does not charge any fees for this service.

## Opt-In

Participation in YNAB Budget Alerts is by invitation only. Household members are added to the service by the account owner after providing explicit verbal or written consent. There is no public sign-up. By participating, you agree to these Terms and Conditions and our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

## Opt-Out

You can stop receiving messages at any time by texting **STOP** to the number from which you receive alerts. After sending **STOP**, you will receive a final confirmation message and no further messages will be sent. To resume messages, contact the account owner directly.

## Help

For help or questions about the service, text **HELP** to the number from which you receive alerts, or contact the account owner directly via phone or the household messaging group.

## Supported Carriers

## Liability

YNAB Budget Alerts is provided on an "as-is" basis for personal household use. The account owner makes no warranties regarding the accuracy of transaction categorization or the reliability of message delivery. Transaction data is sourced from automated bank alerts and may occasionally be incomplete or delayed. Always verify transactions directly with your financial institution.
