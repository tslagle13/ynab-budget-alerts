# Consent & Opt-In Policy

**YNAB Budget Alerts**
*Last updated: February 9, 2026*

## How Consent Is Obtained

YNAB Budget Alerts is a private, invitation-only household messaging service. There is no public sign-up, no marketing list, and no way for anyone to self-enroll. Participants are added exclusively by the account owner through the following process:

### Step 1: Personal Invitation

The account owner personally invites each household member to participate in the service. This invitation includes a clear explanation of:

- What the service does (sends automated transaction alerts from shared bank accounts)
- What types of messages they will receive (transaction notifications, category confirmations, budget updates)
- How often they can expect messages (approximately 1–5 per day, depending on spending activity)
- How to stop receiving messages at any time (reply **STOP**)

### Step 2: Explicit Agreement

Each household member provides explicit consent before being added. Consent is obtained through one of the following methods:

- **Verbal consent** — given in person or by phone, acknowledged by the account owner
- **Written consent** — provided via text message, email, or other written communication

No one is added to the service without first agreeing to participate.

### Step 3: First-Message Confirmation

Upon being added, each participant receives an initial welcome message confirming their enrollment:

> Welcome to YNAB Budget Alerts! You'll receive transaction notifications for our shared household budget. Reply HELP for help or STOP to opt out at any time. Msg & data rates may apply. Msg frequency varies.

This message serves as a final confirmation that the participant has been enrolled and provides immediate instructions for opting out.

## Who Can Receive Messages

Only members of the account owner's household who have completed the consent process above. As of the date of this policy, the service includes a maximum of two participants.

## Opt-Out

Participants can opt out at any time by replying **STOP** to any message. Upon opting out:

- A final confirmation message is sent: *"You've been unsubscribed from YNAB Budget Alerts. No further messages will be sent. Reply START to re-subscribe."*
- No further messages will be sent to that participant
- The participant can re-enroll at any time by contacting the account owner and replying **START**

## Help

Participants can text **HELP** at any time to receive support information:

> *YNAB Budget Alerts: Automated transaction notifications for household budget management. For help, contact the account owner directly. Reply STOP to unsubscribe. Msg & data rates may apply.*

## No Third-Party Opt-In

Consent is never obtained through third parties, purchased lists, or automated means. Every participant is personally known to the account owner and has individually agreed to receive messages.

## Revocation of Consent

Consent can be revoked at any time through any of the following methods:

- Replying **STOP** to any message
- Verbally requesting removal from the service
- Contacting the account owner through any channel

Revocation is processed immediately, and no further messages will be sent.
